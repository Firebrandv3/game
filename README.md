## Welcome To Veloren!

Veloren is a multiplayer voxel RPG written in Rust. Veloren takes inspiration from games such as Cube World, Minecraft and Dwarf Fortress. The game is currently under heavy development, but is playable. At the moment you can explore the procedurally generated world in multiplayer mode and use basic text chat.

## Developement

Currently the communication of contributors happens mainly on our [official discord server](https://discord.gg/kjwJwjK). You can join it to keep up with developement, talk to us or contribute something yourself. Anyone who shows genuine effort to help is welcome in our team. You don't have to know how to program to contribute!

**GitHub is just a read only copy.** For active development and creating issues, please look at our [GitLab Repository](https://gitlab.com/veloren/game)
